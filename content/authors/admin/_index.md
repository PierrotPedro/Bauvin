I am an engineer in applied mathematics, and PhD in biostatistics, currently working at Zoī, a cutting-edge holistic approach to health and preventive medicine, as Data Scientist in the R&D team on prediction and causal challenges applied to health and behavioural sciences.

I help answer public health questions and health-related issues using machine learning, statistics and experts' inputs. I am particularly fond of prediction models to forecast patients' outcomes from large datasets, causal inference to estimate the impact of features for decision-making from observational data, and expert systems to model complex processes.

Coding and calculus are actually small parts of my work; most of my energy goes to understanding clinicians and patients needs, and communicate to experts about my methods and results. I am determined to carry out my projects to testing and operational phase.
