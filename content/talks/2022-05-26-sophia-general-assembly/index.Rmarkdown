I was honored to be awarded first place in the [SOPHIA Young Scientist Award 2021](https://imisophia.eu/news-events/sophia-young-scientist-award/ "https://imisophia.eu/news-events/sophia-young-scientist-award/") for my talk summarizing my institute's work within the SOPHIA project.

As a subsequent reward, I was (even more!) honored to be invited to do the closing remarks at the 2022 SOPHIA General Assembly, hosted by Novo Nordisk in Favrholm, Denmark in april.

Difficult task, the closing remarks! Perilous one! Especially for a young Data Scientist like me, to summarize great talks from renown experts about obesity challenges, such as Dr. Lee Michael Kaplan, Associate Professor of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, or Prof. Nick Finer, Senior Principal Clinical Scientist at Novo Nordisk, and many others.

I cannot give away any slides, because the talk was done without. 

I am sure I could have done better, but as an advice for any fellow who should go through this: don't try to summarize every pieces and subtleties of the talks. For my part, I'm sure that I didn't grasp all of them. Recalling the main messages, highlighting the most powerful images and figures, from my perspective, proved to be efficient and impacting.

All in all, it was an amazing and formative experience!
